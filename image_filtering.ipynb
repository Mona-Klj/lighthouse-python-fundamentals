    "# Image filtering tutorial\n",
    "In this notebook, we will see how to use Python to solve a real-life data science problem! We will look through a folder containing image files and filter it so that we are left with only high-resolution images, which could be a step in our data cleaning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "If we want to build a model that takes image data as input (e.g. an image classifier), we first need to obtain a dataset of images to work with. For instance, we might right a data mining script that scrapes the web for images of different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are we done at this point? Absolutely not. We might want to filter the data to retain only certain images. For instance, images blindly scraped from the web come in all shapes and sizes, and we might only want to keep images that are above a certain resolution to impose a lower bound on quality. This is exactly what we are going to do in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our goal\n",
    "Given a directory (folder) containing image files, create a new directory that only contains the images which have a height and width greater than or equal to some `height_min` and `width_min`. For this tutorial, let's say that `height_min` and `width_min` are both `400`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we'll learn about\n",
    "- Control flow (loops and conditionals)\n",
    "- Data structures (strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries)\n",
    "- Errors\n",
    "- The `os` package for filesystem manipulations\n",
    "- The `PILLOW` package for reading image files\n",
    "- How to think through intended program logic before writing code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "Since we're working with image data, we need a package that will let us read\n",
    "image files and their resolutions (height and width). For this, we will be using\n",
    "the `PILLOW` package. Open your command line, activate your virtual environment,\n",
    "and install PILLOW using the comands below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate your virual environment (you don't need to do this if your already see `(base)` at the\n",
    "start of your console line).\n",
    "```\n",

    "Install PILLOW\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Note**:\n",
    "In this notebook, I repeat a lot of code in each cell. This is not necessary (and undesirable), as variables you define in previous cells\n",
    "continue to exist in subsequent ones. I am only doing it here for education purposes so that we can see all the code at once."

This will make your code more readable, and it will make it easier to modify them in one place rather than having to find them all over your code.\n",
    "2. **Use descriptive and accurate variable names**. Do we really have a list of `files`? More accurately, we have a list of `filenames`. Don't be afraid to use longer, more descriptive variable names.\n",
    "3. **Use intermediate variable names**. Rather than bunch up multiple steps in one line, split them up into multiple lines and give meaningful intermediate variable names. For instance, `raw_images/' + file` is a file path. On a separate line, we can make this explicit. This will make your code more readable (if a bit longer).\n",
    "4. **Use comments to describe abstract logic**. Comments help make clear what you're trying to achieve, and helps other programmers quickly understand what your code does at a high-level. You don't need to comment every line, as your code should be informative on its own (e.g. by using good variable names), but you should try commenting blocks of code."
